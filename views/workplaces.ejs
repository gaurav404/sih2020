Presumably, single women without children have the social freedom to work, while single women with children have an economic necessity to do so, even as married women have more responsibilities inside the house as well as different societal norms to follow.</span>

                    <strong style="color: black;">The Rohini Pande paper provides another interesting insight, in that, despite the barriers and the current social paradigm, women are still interested in having a &#x201C;regular&#x201D; job, rather than some occasional work. </strong>
                    <span style="color: black;">Yet, there is a definite preference for a steady and predictable part-time work versus regular full-time work as shown in the figure below. </span>

                    <span style="color: black;">Through Sattva&#x2019;s multiple skilling and livelihood programmes aimed at women, one of which was aimed at creating opportunities for underprivileged women to work in high-end retail firms, it became increasingly evident that </span>

                    <span style="color: black;">. The programme, which focused on building the skills of 12th pass and graduate women in retail sales, saw a number of success stories of women getting access to decent jobs with high-end brands and continuing to grow in their careers. However, it became clear very soon that </span>
                    <strong style="color: black;">bringing women into the workforce is a complex, multi-dimensional problem</strong>

                </h3>
                <p>Much has been written about the patriarchal culture of India, which is evident across most communities. For unmarried young girls, parents are still the decision-makers when it comes to education or employment, and most parents continue to view it their primary duty to get their daughter &#x201C;married off&#x201D;, with employment, in general, and sales-related roles, in particular, only serving to complicate marriage prospects. </p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>For many women, crossing the hurdle of going against the family is just too much trouble.</strong>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: black;">While it&#x2019;s a well-known fact that the large majority of Indian women are not the primary decision makers in the family, it&#x2019;s a lesser known fact that many of them do not view working as something aspirational nor of holding any personal significance. The primary reason for this is a lack of relevant role models for women, no matter what their background. </span>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <span style="color: black;">The few well-known successful women seem too far away from their reality to serve as effective role models. Often, this lack of aspiration is dismissed as &#x201C;but women don&#x2019;t </span>

                    <span style="color: black;"> to work&#x201D; and justified as a choice women make independently. However, more often than not, women are conditioned to think in ways that are aligned with the prevalent norms. </span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: black;">To tackle this problem early on, many non-profit organisations such as Voice4Girls, Antarang Foundation, and DreamADream, amongst others, are giving young girls the opportunity to dream big by showing the benefits of agency and choice at an early age. However, </span>
                    <strong style="color: black;">this lack of aspiration and early thought conditioning towards working outside the home, especially in male-dominated fields, remains one of the biggest roadblocks in improving the participation of women in the workforce.</strong>

                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">Unsurprisingly, the lack of suitable support systems such as child-care or elder-care is one of the biggest barriers for women to work. </span>
                    <strong style="color: black;">By design, our work systems are not built to provide the flexibility that is critical for a woman, especially during certain life-stages, and working part-time often translates to stagnancy and low growth opportunities.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"> Interestingly, families become more supportive of women working post-marriage and after having children, as it becomes an economic imperative at this point to have a second income for the household. </span>
                </p>
                <blockquote class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">However, in the non-agricultural sector, apart from jobs such as teaching, home-tuitions, and some factory jobs, it is not very easy for a woman to take up a regular, full-time job outside the house, given that the majority of the household and childcare responsibilities fall on the woman. </span>

                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">As per a UN report, Indian women do more than 300 minutes a day of unpaid work compared to men. The silver lining in this is that come January 2019, the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) will measure domestic work to better understand how women contribute to the nation&#x2019;s economy. Secondly, the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, brought about a number of beneficial changes, including 26 weeks of paid maternity leave and mandatory cr&#xE8;che facilities in establishments employing more than 50 employees. Implementation of the Act remains to be seen.</span>

                    <span style="color: black;">In our experience, we found that women tend to be enthusiastic about skilling courses in retail, but many tended not to take up these jobs once the time came for them to join the workforce. </span>

                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">In our programme, we also found that sexual harassment laws were often not explained clearly to women employees, and franchisee stores were not monitored regularly on their implementation of harassment policies. One of our students* was abused verbally with sexual innuendos by her immediate superior, which caused her to abstain from work for extended periods of time without providing any reason for her absence. Being the primary earner in the family, she was afraid to make this an issue, fearing the loss of her job. She confided in the programme managers and the issues were resolved with the HR and the franchisee owner in a tactful manner. </span>

                    <strong style="color:  #007bff;">Workplace diversity: cost or investment? </strong>
                </h2>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">For most employers, focusing on diversity in the workplace immediately signals the need for upfront investments in terms of policies and support services, in addition to training.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"> To cite an example, there is an organisation that trains women to become drivers and they impart driving plus customer engagement skills. While this potentially highlights a large market opportunity, given the number of crimes against women by male cab drivers today, the cost of training women is at least twice that of training men. A little digging told us why. In almost every case, women have multiple responsibilities at home &#x2013; primarily cooking, child-care, and elder-care apart from the dozen other things they have to do. Taking time out to acquire employable skills requires working around these schedules and responsibilities, which typically means fewer hours per day and hence lower trainer utilisation. All of these result in higher cost of training while entering the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">As one goes higher up the ladder, an employee would necessarily have larger responsibilities. For example, in fields such as retail and customer service, the store manager is required to stay back beyond the last shift to tally the accounts and the inventory or assume the task of managing more than one branch or one team. This, in turn, forces women to reconsider their choices and, more often than not, resign themselves to quieting their own ambitions to be better able to deliver their household responsibilities and avoid disturbing the family dynamics. </span>
                    <strong style="color: black;">Enabling women to perform these roles would mean providing extra support to handle their responsibilities at home (e.g. childcare beyond regular hours), allowing flexible shifts or providing additional staff support, including additional security during late hours. </strong>
                </p>
                <blockquote class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">However, it is not just women who need flexibility or other support services in the workplace. Today, in many industries, men are automatically assigned to the later shifts and expected to work longer hours. Flexible and fair policies will enable all employees to be more productive without creating further discrimination or stereotyping against one specific group.</span>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">As such, </span>
                    <strong style="color: black;">employers need to start thinking long term, looking for innovative solutions to provide flexible support systems that are not only beneficial for women, but for all employees within the organisation.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"> The benefits of such measures may not be easy to quantify just yet, but there are already several employers who are doing this because it makes business (and social) sense to them.</span>

                <h2 class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color:  #007bff;">The good news: some employers are already showing the way</strong>
                </h2>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">The IT/BPO sector was one of the first in the country which realised the value of tapping into the female workforce. A recent NASSCOM press release states that more than half the IT/BPO firms will have up to 60 percent women in senior levels and 20 percent in the C-Suite soon. They further stated that </span>
                    <strong style="color: black;">&#x201C;</strong>
                    <strong>HR policies such as conveyance, flexi-work, work-from-home, parental leave, anti-harassment, (and) healthcare have led to the positive trend&#x201D;.</strong>
                    <em></em>
                    This development comes on the back of continued growth and profitability of the technology and BPO industry.
                </p>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">While it may be easier to have flexible policies around work in the IT industry, even industries that don&#x2019;t generally take to flexibility are doing their bit to make it easier for women (and men) to work. Take the case of Tata&#x2019;s Starbucks, one of the employers we worked with as part of our retail programme that has an organisational mandate on gender diversity. </span>

                    <span style="color: black;">Starbucks has invested in a number of effective interventions for women. These include interactions with family and friends at the workplace, flexible working hours for young mothers, and structured career paths for part-timers. Women are not penalised for part-time work when it comes to promotions and there are a number of successful cases of part-timers becoming shift managers and store managers. </span>

                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">As more employers define the new norms of a workplace, especially given the changing nature of work itself, the business case for gender diversity should finally find wider acceptance.</span>
                </p>
                <h2 class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color:  #007bff;">What would it take to create an equitable workforce? </strong>
                </h2>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">The first step towards building an equitable workforce is building awareness about job roles and opportunities amongst women and their families.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"> This cannot be done without taking into consideration existing cultural practices. However, our experience shows that economics usually trumps culture. Once families realise that the woman of the house can be an active contributor, support typically increases. </span>
                </p>
                <blockquote class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">But that first step of sensitising parents, spouses, siblings, and the woman herself about the potential of women outside of the boundaries of the house is critical. This point has been well articulated by </span>
                    <a href="http://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/getting-indias-women-into-the-workforce-time-for-a-smart-approach.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="disablePointerEvents" style="color: black;">Rohini Pande</a>
                    ,
                    <span style="color: black;"> who says policy responses could prove critical when the problem is rooted in social and behavioural norms, rather than a lack of resources. </span>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">An interesting recommendation, supported with evidence from the micro-credit sector, is the need to foster women&#x2019;s social networks. </strong>
                    <span style="color: black;">Women are more likely to complete courses, take loans for business purposes and report higher household income and consumption when they bring a friend along. Investing in scalable behavioural change initiatives to break prevailing gender stereotypes at a national scale will call for some bold philanthropy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">Secondly, partnering with forward-thinking employers to demonstrate scalable solutions is equally crucial, something Sattva has been actively working on.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"> As seen earlier, customer experience is one field where there is already a strong business case for employing more women. By working with progressive employers in high-growth industries and implementing specific interventions targeted at increasing the number of women, a wider case for employment of women can be established. This would require investment in ecosystem building activities such as research and measurement systems to build the evidence at an organisational level, not just at a macroeconomic one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">Thirdly, investing in women&#x2019;s employability to enter or re-enter the workforce and providing flexible opportunities for women acquire the necessary job-related skills, while keeping the various demands on their time in mind is critical. </strong>
                    <span style="color: black;">In a world where blended learning is fast becoming the norm, women are naturally placed to make the most of this trend. As part of our work, we hope to bring about further innovation in making low-cost, flexible training programmes available for women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">Finally, the wide gap in Indian women&#x2019;s participation in the workforce only means that there will be a cost associated with bridging this gap.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"> While this cost would ultimately need to be borne by the employers and the women (and their families) themselves, in the short term, this would require significant support from the government as well as philanthropic organisations -- both for advocating and creating policy and systems, as well as for implementing them.</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote class="ql-align-justify">
                    <strong style="color: black;">Having said that, we truly believe that these are not &#x201C;costs&#x201D;, but &#x201C;investments&#x201D; in the country&#x2019;s future.</strong>
                    <span style="color: black;"></span>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="ql-align-justify">
                    <span style="color: black;">It is our hope that many other women will no longer have to fight alone nor have to give up on their dreams of being a part of the workforce. It is our hope, too, that they have equal opportunities to live productive and meaningful lives, earning the respect and credit that they are due, both in the workplace and in their communities. Why, you may ask. The answer to this question is simple and aptly summed up in a popular tagline:</span>
